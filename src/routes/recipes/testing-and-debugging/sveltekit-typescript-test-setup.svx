## The toolchain

If you are fairly new to Svelte(kit) or web development, the process of setting up a test toolchain can be failry frustrating (at least it was for me).This guide will help you to setup a toolchain to write unit tests for Svelte Components and business logic within your SvelteKit api endpoints.

Here is what we will use to test our Sveltekit app.

- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
- [ts-node](https://typestrong.org/ts-node/)
- [ts-jest](https://github.com/kulshekhar/ts-jest)
- [Svelte-Jester](https://github.com/mihar-22/svelte-jester#typescript)
- [Svelte Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/svelte-testing-library/intro)

## Setup

First things first. Let's generate a new SvelteKit project.

```bash
npm init svelte@next my-app
cd my-app
npm install
```

Answer the questions as shown in the screenshot.

Now we install all the devDependencies we need

```bash
npm install --save-dev jest ts-jest ts-node svelte-jester @testing-library/svelte @testing-library/jest-dom
```

Ok now we need to add some configuration to get everything up and running.

Create a [jest config file](https://github.com/christianp86/svelte-ts-testing-toolchain/blob/main/my-app/jest.config.js) file with the following content

```js
export default {
	preset: 'ts-jest',
	transformIgnorePatterns: ['<rootDir>/node_modules/'],
	transform: {
		'^.+\\.svelte$': [
			'svelte-jester',
			{
				preprocess: true
			}
		],
		'^.+\\.ts$': 'ts-jest'
	},
	moduleFileExtensions: ['js', 'ts', 'svelte'],
	setupFilesAfterEnv: ['@testing-library/jest-dom/extend-expect']
};
```

To run the tests we add the following command to our package.json

```js
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest src",
    "test:watch": "npm run test -- --watch"
  }
}
```

Now we run our first test

```bash
npm run test
```

The result should be similar to this

## Writing our first test

Now it is time to write our first test for our SvelteKit app.
There are many opinions about tests (in which folder do they belong, which postfix should be used, ...).

We follow this pattern:

- Tests will be written in \*.spec.ts files
- Tests belong into the same directory as the to be tested source code

So we have a [index.svelte](https://github.com/christianp86/svelte-ts-testing-toolchain/blob/1.0.0/my-app/src/routes/index.svelte) file. This Svelte Component creates a heading and a paragraph with text.
We will test if the heading is being displaid.

```js
/**
 * @jest-environment jsdom
 */

import '@testing-library/jest-dom';
import { render } from '@testing-library/svelte';
import Index from './index.svelte';

test('shows proper heading when rendered', () => {
	const { getByText } = render(Index);

	expect(getByText('Welcome to SvelteKit')).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

The mist important part is the comment on top of our .spec.ts file. This indicates jest that we want to test using jest-dom.
The default is a node.js like environment. If you only want to test your svelte components and no apis, stores, ... you could also add this directly into your jest config.

```sh
testEnvironment: 'jsdom',
```

More detailed information can be found [here](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#testenvironment-string).

Now let's run our test again.

```sh
npm run test
```

You should see this result

### Additional info and links

Well that is it. You should now have a working test toolchain that allows you to test each part of your SvelteKit application. Enjoy ðŸ˜„
Also check out the already [existing recipe for testing svelte components](https://sveltesociety.dev/recipes/testing-and-debugging/unit-testing-svelte-component).

I have a added all links and resources I used to build this recipe for the sveltekit ts toolchain.
